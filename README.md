# Bagatelle3
An exercise in granular synthesis

Written as an assignment for West Chester University's computer music class and adapted from an example of how to use the LiSa (live sampling) unit generator built into the ChucK language, this program takes an audio file, breaks it into many pieces, and plays them back at various speeds in many voices. The program is launched from Bagatelle3.ck with the supporting programs filling in additional voices in the left and right stereo channels. Parameters were selected based on a friend's recording of William Walton's third bagatelle for classical guitar and the output of the program using this recording is included as a WAV file.
